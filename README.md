# Fit to Print
This is my insight project, completed in 3 weeks.
More to come, but briefly, this tool analyzes the writing styles of major publications. It is designed to take a new article, 
return the best stylistic match, and highlight some areas that could be changed to make the article more consistent with 
the writing style of a desired publication.
